<h1>My Daily Motivation</h1>
<h1 id="firstTry">Good Evening!</h1>
<div>It’s no use going back to yesterday,</div>
<div>because I was a different person then.</div>
<p>One day, a man was walking by a road when he heard a cat meowing
    from the bushes nearby. The cat was stuck and needed help getting
    out. When the man reached out, the cat got scared and scratched
    the man. The man screamed in pain but didn’t back down. He tried
    again and again, even as the cat continued to scratch his hands.</p>
<p>Another passerby saw this and said, “Just let it be! The cat will
    find a way to come out later”. The man didn’t pay heed but tried
    until he helped the cat. Once he let the cat free, he told the
    other man, “The cat is an animal, and its instincts make him
    scratch and attack. I am a human and my instincts make me
    compassionate and kind”.</p>
